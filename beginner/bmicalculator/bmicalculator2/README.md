Here's a comprehensive list of features, functionalities and elements present in the code:
Features
BMI Calculation: Calculates Body Mass Index based on user's weight and height.
BMI Category Determination: Determines BMI category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) based on calculated BMI.
Health Risk Assessment: Provides health risk assessment based on BMI category.
Data Storage: Stores user data in a JSON file for persistence.
Data Retrieval: Allows users to view saved data.
Data Visualization: Displays BMI category distribution using a bar chart.
Statistics Calculation: Calculates average weight, height and BMI.
Functionalities
User Input: Accepts user input for weight, height and name.
Unit Conversion: Converts weight and height units (kg/lb, m/cm/in).
Error Handling: Handles invalid user input and calculations.
Menu-Driven Interface: Provides interactive menu for user options.
Data Validation: Validates user data before saving.
Elements
Classes: BMICalculator class encapsulates data and methods.
Methods: calculate_bmi, get_bmi_category, get_health_risk, add_user_data, view_user_data, visualize_data, calculate_statistics.
Attributes: bmi_categories, health_risks, data_file, data.
JSON File: Stores user data in "bmi_data.json".
Matplotlib Library: Utilizes matplotlib for data visualization.
Conditional Statements: Implements conditional logic for calculations and data handling.
Loops: Employs loops for data processing and visualization.
Design Principles
Modularity: Organized code with separate methods for calculations, data handling and visualization.
Encapsulation: BMICalculator class encapsulates data and methods.
Separation of Concerns: Distinct sections for calculations, data handling and visualization.
Best Practices
Readability: Clear variable names, comments and docstrings.
Maintainability: Organized code structure and modular design.
Efficiency: Optimized calculations and data handling.
